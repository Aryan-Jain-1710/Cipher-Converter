## Purpose
This project was created to learn more about how ciphers work and understand the importance of ciphers in the world of cryptography. As I wish to pursue a career in the field of cybersecurity, I wanted to learn more about how encryption and decryption works.
I also wanted to learn more about the tkinter library and how to create a GUI with it. Thus, I decided to create a graphical user interface based application that allows the user to encrypt and decrypt messages from multiple ciphers.
